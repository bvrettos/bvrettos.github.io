Kalispera!

I am a graduate of the Eletrical and Computer Engineering school of NTUA. Currently working as a researcher in the Computing Systems Laboratory of NTUA, my main interests include optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) applications and systems through performance analysis. I am currently focusing on GPU-accelerated Linear Algebra applications executed on large scale clusters. I am also interested in increasing the performance of complex simulation and computer-aided design (CAD) software through heterogeneous computation.
